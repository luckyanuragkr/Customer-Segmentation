# Project Problem Statement: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering

**Background & Motivation:**
Customer segmentation is a crucial process in marketing and business strategy, allowing companies to understand and categorize their customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and spending patterns. Traditional segmentation techniques often rely on predefined categories, but machine learning techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN provide data-driven segmentation that can uncover hidden patterns.

**Problem Statement:**
The goal of this project is to implement and compare two clustering techniques, K-Means and DBSCAN, for customer segmentation based on spending patterns and annual income. The primary challenges include:

Identifying optimal customer groups that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies.

Evaluating the effectiveness of K-Means vs. DBSCAN in segmenting customers.

Detecting outliers (anomalous customers) who do not fit into standard spending patterns.

Assessing the clustering performance using metrics like Silhouette Score and visualizations.

**Project Scope:**

Dataset: The project utilizes customer data of a mall containing attributes such as Gender,Age,	Annual Income and Spending Score.

**Clustering Methods**:
K-Means Clustering (suitable for well-separated clusters)
DBSCAN Clustering (capable of detecting outliers and irregularly shaped clusters)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
Silhouette Score for measuring clustering quality.
Visualization techniques to interpret customer segments.

**Business Insights**:
Understanding different customer groups based on spending behavior.
Identifying potential high-value customers and budget-conscious consumers.
Developing targeted marketing strategies based on segmented groups.

**Expected Outcomes:**
A well-defined customer segmentation model using K-Means and DBSCAN.

Comparative analysis of clustering performance and business implications.

Recommendations for businesses to leverage customer segmentation insights for marketing and product positioning.
